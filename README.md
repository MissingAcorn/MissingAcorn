You never know the odd things I am capable of.

I have many odd ideas, including stories of Demons, stories of Dogs, and stories of mysteriously vague forest creatures.

Current Projects:
  - Heart-Scar: The story of an Archfiend taken from an eternaly odd dimension with no memory, but a rather dangerous past.
  - DogFight: A spiritual successor to StarFox 64 and GoldenEye 007 (N64) with a hard limit of Dogs only.
  - The Caretaker: {[REDACTED]}
